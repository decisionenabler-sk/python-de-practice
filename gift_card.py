# Imagine you're a VP at FAANG, and you want to reward your team with gifts at the end of the year during Christmas time. 
# You check in with stingy HR, and the best they could do is scrounge up a limited set of gift cards – each with different values and to various stores.
# Each teammate has different expectations for their end-of-year gift – your Director expects a $1000+ gift card for something luxurious, while the new grad on your team would be thrilled with something as simple as a $10 gift card to Starbucks.
# You can only give each person at most one gift card, and if a gift card doesn’t meet someone’s minimum expectation, it’s better not to give them one at all, as we definitely don't want to disappoint.
# Find a way to satisfy as many teammates as possible by assigning each one a gift card that meets or exceeds their expectation.
# Return the maximum number of teammates you can make satisfy.
